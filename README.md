# Clicky Game

## Overview

This is a memory game created with React. The application's UI is broken up into components,  and the application manages component states and responds to user events.

### Details

3. The application renders different images to the screen. Each image listens for click events.

4. The application keeps track of the user's score. The user's score is incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's is be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

5. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order.

6. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
